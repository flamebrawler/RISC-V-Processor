# PD6

In this PD, you are required to run your pipelined processor design on board.

## Probes

You will need to fill in the `signals.h` in this PD for the probes.

Please note that unlike in PD0, we only **monitor** these probes instead of driving the probes.

## Testbench, Synthesis, and Implementation

Refer to the lab manual for detailed information.

## Submission

In `project/pd6/verif/scripts/`, use `make package VERILATOR=1` to package your code and create a `package.verilator.tar.gz`

You will need to upload the `package.verilator.tar.gz` to learn when done.
